# Information and code to download recordings to prepare for birding trips

I've found that the best way to learn calls (apart from actually getting out and birding) is to listen to recordings over and over and over again. Training the neural net, if you will. Well, that is annoying and laborious to do manually on eBird or Merlin. Therefore it is desirable to assemble a playlist that can be listened to (and re-listened to) while doing other tasks like driving, cooking, etc., to learn bird calls. But. Downloading lots of Xeno-Canto recordings is a huge pain in the ass. 

Here is a semi-automated way to download recordings for focal areas; once downloaded, these recordings can be put on a phone and collated into Spotify playlists. 

## Step 1. Get species list and frequencies for focal regions or hotspots from eBird. 

For this example, I want to download recordings for reguarly reported species from Kaeng Krachan National Park in Thailand. To get barcharts, navigate: eBird home > Explore > Barcharts. You can specify a region (state, county, province) OR hotspots within a region. I specified the 20 or so hotspots within and near Kaeng Krachan National Park. Once the barcharts load, there is a link ("Download Histogram Data") to download a .txt file with data from the barchart:
